a card game

Python code
python3 -m http.server 1000


Bug list: 
* End game win conditions do not work

To-do
* Is it horse-themed? 
* When bonusGodl is added, how do we tell this to the player in the UI
* Turn off hover state and hand-cursor for Treasure and Victory cards in hand
* Add data tracker
* After troubleshooting, make sure that the Deck Inventory shows all cards you own and not what's in discard
