# Horses
a deck-building card game

Python code
python3 -m http.server 5500


Bug list: 

To-do
* Take out Throne Room or replace
* Come up with some better level design 
* Harbinger, limit 5 cards per row when showing 10 total per page
* Fix the Final Gold / Accumulate Gold win condition
On level start screen, swap level name and level number so number is more obvious
* Does Remodel have pagination? 
* Update the .sold-out class to be black and text-center
When you fail and have to try again, it changes teh game rules rather than just resetting the action-cards but keeping the same rules
* Fix the CSS for Adventurer modal. Cards should be in a flex container, flex-direction row, with h4 headings above them
