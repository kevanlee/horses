# Horses
a deck-building card game

Python code
python3 -m http.server 5500


Bug list: 
* Harbinger - Sometimes Harbinger's button says Discard
* Vassal - the Action card I draw does not get its effects applied
* Turn counter is missing its colon
* Randomize gold+VP at first hand
* Masquerade - button says Trash / Discard Selected when it shouldn't, e.g. after a card with a modal is played on a previous hand, like Cellar
* Masquerade - the card you don't choose gets lost somewhere (trashed? abandoned?)
* Cellar and Chapel don't show up in my game inventory
* Add code so that any trashed card gets added to trash pile (Chapel)

To-do
* Restyle 
* Add win conditions
* Add data tracker
* After troubleshooting, make sure that the Deck Inventory shows all cards you own and not what's in discard
* Implement Throne Room modal cards (Cellar, Chapel, Workshop, Feast, Mine, Remodel, Masquerade, Harbinger, Library, Vassal, Adventurer) - currently show message that they need special implementation
